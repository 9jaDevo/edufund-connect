## 🎨 Design System

Your existing design system is preserved:

```javascript
colors: {
  primary: { 500: '#0F766E' },    // Teal
  secondary: { 300: '#fcd34d' },   // Yellow
  accent: { 500: '#22C55E' },      // Green
  error: { 500: '#ef4444' },       // Red
  success: { 500: '#22c55e' },     // Green
}
```

## 📊 Key Differences from Current Setup

| Feature | Current (Vite) | New (Next.js) |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Routing | React Router | Next.js App Router |
| Auth | Mock passwords | Supabase Auth |
| Data Fetching | Client-side | SSR + Client-side |
| API Routes | Supabase Edge Functions | Next.js API Routes + Edge Functions |
| Rendering | CSR | SSR + CSR + ISR |
| SEO | Limited | Full control |
| Performance | Good | Excellent (with RSC) |

## 🎯 Why Next.js for This Project?

### 1. **SEO & Public Pages**
- Project listings need to be indexed by Google
- Public transparency pages benefit from SSR
- Better social media sharing with meta tags

### 2. **Performance**
- Server Components reduce bundle size
- Automatic code splitting
- Built-in image optimization

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- File-based routing
- API routes in same project
- TypeScript built-in
- Better build times

### 4. **Scalability**
- Edge runtime support
- ISR for dynamic content
- Built-in optimization
- Easy deployment (Vercel)

### 5. **Enterprise Ready**
- Used by companies like Netflix, Twitch, TikTok
- Strong community support
- Regular updates and improvements
- Excellent documentation

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Protected Routes**: Middleware checks auth on every request
- **Server Actions**: Secure mutations without exposing API keys
- **Environment Variables**: Properly separated (NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client)
- **CSRF Protection**: Built into Next.js
- **Rate Limiting**: Easy to implement with middleware

## 📈 Expected Performance

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds (with optimization)
- **Navigation**: < 500ms (with prefetching)
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ (with proper setup)

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

You have **two options**:

### Option A: Clean Start (Recommended)
1. Create new Next.js project
2. Migrate components gradually
3. Keep Vite version for reference
4. Switch DNS when ready

**Pros**: Clean architecture, best practices from start
**Cons**: Takes time to migrate everything

### Option B: Parallel Development
1. Keep Vite for current users
2. Build Next.js in parallel
3. Migrate users gradually

**Pros**: Zero downtime
**Cons**: Maintaining two codebases temporarily
